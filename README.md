# RCoin

RCoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer currency building upon the ideas of Bitcoin. In comparison with other cryptocurrencies,
RCoin does not eliminate transaction fees, nor keep them at ridiculously high rates even for small transactions. Transaction
fees are determined as a fixed 1.5% of a transaction's amount. RCoin is designed to be ASIC resistant by requiring relatively
large amounts of memory per hash (6-12MB).
